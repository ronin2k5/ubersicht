# Ubersicht
This is a collection of Ubersicht widgets developed by myself.

For those who don't know, Ubersicht is a desktop widget engine for macOS. It lets you create HTML widgets out of any command that can be typed at the terminal.

For more information on Ubersicht, you can check out their [official website](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/).

If installing any of these widgets, remember to open the source and edit the command path and widget position as requred.
